### Why i Made This?
i always Wnated to create A hardware based Game, so pathfinder hepled me and give me a motivation so that i could make a tick on my bucket list , also i thanks to meghana , she hepled me out in every doubt is asked i liked her patience and kindness which led to make React Finder 

### Some Key Features 

* 4 LEDs Turn on in a random Order 
* Press buttons to repeat the correct sequence with A buzzer beep
* Win = buzzer celebration sound + level up
* Lose = if you were un Successfull in Order ,buzzer fail tone + restart game
